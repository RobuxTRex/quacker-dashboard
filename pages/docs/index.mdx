# Quacker Discord Bot

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    These docs are proof-of-concept and are not final. Some features listed below may not come to be, or are currently in development and incomplete.
</Callout>

Quacker is an extremely well-made, feature-rich Discord bot aimed to become the best of all.
Over the years, I have noticed that there is no such bot that can do everything.
For example, there is no bot that combines the best of MEE6, Dyno, Ticket Bot and Modmail.
Though, Quacker **can do those things**! Quacker also **does not have any Premium subscriptions or paywalls**; it's all completely open-source and free-to-use.
We are planning to add a donation link, but donating won't give you anything besides from a cheeky <a href="" class="text-blue-500">**discord role**</a>.

## Features

- Modmail
- Moderaion Commands
- DM Features
- Currency 
- XP System
- Interactive Verification Authentication
- Detailed Server Statistics**
- And a **whole lot more**!

## Commands

Commands can be viewed discretely below this entry in the sidebar.

## Support Quacker

Currently, there are not many ways to support the development of the Quacker bot!
The least you could do at the moment is to **star the repository on GitHub (click the GitHub icon at the top right)** or **join our Discord Server (also an icon at the top right)**.
We appreciate all of the support!

## Test Quacker

Testing is currently closed, but you can experiment with some of our available commands for members with default permissions in our Discord Server.
Just hop into the Community Testing Channel in the Discord server to test some of the commands, like the Levelling System or Currency System.

### Disclaimers

** Detailed Server Statistics is yet to be added, and may not exist in the first public release.
